  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Korean Fried Chicken is known for its ultra-crispy texture achieved through a double-frying process. The chicken is marinated, lightly battered, and then fried twice, resulting in a crunchy crust that stays crisp even when sauced. Itâ€™s often coated in flavorful sauces like sweet-spicy gochujang or soy garlic. Served with pickled radishes, it's a popular dish for pairing with beer or soju.</p>

    <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Batter:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).</li>
    <li>While oil is heating, make batter: Whisk together cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles smooth pancake batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
    <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
